### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs. In this lab, I created a 
    high–low number guessing game that can be played between two users. I
    utilized if–else statements and variables to complete the lab. I enjoyed
    this lab because it allowed me to make a fun and interactive game that 
    could be played by other people, as well as showing me how the code I 
    write can bring joy to others.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, Part 2 was another one of my favorite labs. In this lab, I created 
    a date difference calculator that calculates the number of days between 
    two dates. I used functions, strings, and variables to complete the lab. 
    I enjoyed being able to see how the code I write can be useful to others 
    and serve as an aid in performing everyday tasks.

* Lab 7
    
    Lab 7, Part 1 was another lab that I enjoyed. In this lab, I created a 
    program that tells users if they can park on a specific street. For this 
    lab, I used boolean functions, strings, if-else statements, and variables. 
    I like how this code is another example of how programmers can make 
    everyday mundane tasks a little easier, as well as seeing the real-world 
    application and how this can be used in everyday life.
